Model Evaluation Summary (Random Forest Regressor)
In this project, a Random Forest Regressor was developed to predict Electric Vehicle (EV) sales across different Indian states based on historical data. The model used features such as State, Month, Vehicle Category, Vehicle Type, and Year to learn patterns in sales behavior.

After training and testing, the model achieved strong performance:

MAE (Mean Absolute Error): 11.16

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): 119.21

R² Score: 0.908

These results indicate that the model is highly accurate, typically making predictions within ±11 vehicles, and it explains over 90% of the variance in the data. This makes it a reliable tool for forecasting EV sales trends and understanding which factors most influence EV adoption across different regions.
